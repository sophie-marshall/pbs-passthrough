                powered by facial recognition, passthrough facilitates the retrieval and service or person-specific
                metadata within your video content. 

                passthrough can help viewers enjoy an enhanced viewing experience by providing them with actor/actress names, 
                bios, trivia, and more! 

                inspired by Prime Video's X-Ray service, passthrough aims to provide comparable data using open source technologies.

                at a specified frame rate, the passthrough function extracts frames and applies facial 
                recognition using a multi-task cascaded convolutional neural network (MTCCN). 
                
                identified faces are then embedded using FaceNet for future reference. 
                
                in the provided image, two faces were detected by the MTCNN model, each accompanied by bounding box 
                coordinates and a confidence score.
                
                the image was generated by overlaying green bounding boxes around the detected faces, with 
                annotations indicating their respective confidence scores.

                resulting facial embeddings are used to query a database containing known faces and their associated metadata. 

                for each embedding, best three facial matches are retrieved along with the specified metadata.

                passthrough utilizes the postgreSQL pgvector extension for conducting vector search via cosine similarity.

                results of the query are returned as JSON objects and can be used/displayed in a variety of ways.
